# **Problem Statement**
Grocery shopping looks simple. But the budget somehow slips away every month.
People buy things. Forget what they already purchased. Spend more. And then regret later.
There is no easy way to quickly keep track of items and control the total before it’s too late.
So this project tries to solve that small but real headache.
It gives a basic digital helper that watches your grocery spending silently but smartly.
# **Scope Of The Project**
This is not a full supermarket billing system. Not an app with ads and notifications.
Just a small program that sits in the terminal.
It helps users record grocery items, check how much they are spending, and whether the budget is still safe.
It can also change items later, delete mistakes, and show totals category-wise.
Scope is small. But the impact is surprisingly useful for everyday people.
# **Target Users**
Mostly students,Also families.
Anyone who tries to survive on a limited monthly grocery budget.
People who don’t want complex apps — they just want a simple list and a warning before money runs out.
Perfect for people who buy first and overthink later.
