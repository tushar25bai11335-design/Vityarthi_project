# **Grocery Budget Helper**

A small tool. But kind of useful. And honestly more realistic than it looks.

## **Overview of the Project**

Everyone tries to manage groceries. And the budget keeps running away.
So this program well tries to help.
It allows a person to record what they buy, how much they spend, and what type of item it is.
And when spending goes too far, the program speaks up (politely).
Not a boring calculator — more like someone tracking your spending while you shop.

## **Features**

* This little program has a good number of tricks:

* Add grocery items one by one

* Mark each item as Essential or Non-essential

* Edit items when mistakes happen (they always happen)

* Delete an item you regret buying

* See totals for both categories

* Apply discount directly to the bill (just like shopkeeper offer)

* Final summary + soft suggestions to avoid overspending next month

* It’s not too fancy. But it’s surprisingly powerful for daily use.

## **Technologies / Tools Used**

1-Python (plain, simple, no libraries import)

2-Runs in terminal / command prompt
Basically… if Python runs, the program runs.

**Steps to Install & Run the Project**

You don’t really “install” it.
Just these steps:

1-Install Python (if not already)

2-Download the project folder

3-Go inside /src

4-Open terminal there

5-Run the command

python grocery.py


6-If the screen shows the menu → you’re good to go.

7-Instructions for Testing

**There isn’t any complicated testing.
Just play around with the options, like:**

~ Add a few items

~ Try editing an item

~ Delete one

~ Show category summary

~ Apply discount

~ Press exit and check final bill

Best test is entering things in the wrong way too (typos, numbers, etc.)
The program reacts quite okay.
