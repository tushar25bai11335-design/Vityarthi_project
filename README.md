# Vityarthi_project

**Grocery Budget Helper**
A small tool. But kind of useful. And honestly more realistic than it looks.

**Overview of the Project
**
Everyone tries to manage groceries. And the budget keeps running away.
So this program… well… tries to help.
It allows a person to record what they buy, how much they spend, and what type of item it is.
And when spending goes too far, the program speaks up (politely).
Not a boring calculator — more like someone tracking your spending while you shop.

**Features**

* This little program has a good number of tricks:

>Add grocery items one by one

>Mark each item as Essential or Non-essential

>Edit items when mistakes happen (they always happen)

>Delete an item you regret buying

>See totals for both categories

>Apply discount directly to the bill (just like shopkeeper offer)

>Final summary + soft suggestions to avoid overspending next month

>It’s not too fancy. But it’s surprisingly powerful for daily use.

Technologies / Tools Used

>Python (plain, simple, no libraries imported)

>Runs in terminal / command prompt
Basically… if Python runs, the program runs.

**Steps to Install & Run the Project**

You don’t really “install” it.
Just these steps:

1-Install Python (if not already)

2-Download the project folder

3-Go inside /src

4-Open terminal there

5-Run the command

python grocery.py


6-If the screen shows the menu → you’re good to go.

7-Instructions for Testing

There isn’t any complicated testing.
Just play around with the options, like:

~Add a few items

~Try editing an item

~Delete one

~Show category summary

~Apply discount

~Press exit and check final bill

Best test is entering things in the wrong way too (typos, numbers, etc.)
The program reacts quite okay.
